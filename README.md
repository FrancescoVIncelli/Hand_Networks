# Hand Networks
Characterization of brain networks subtending movement execution and  movement imagination

A dataset of EEG signals acquired during the execution and imagination of the left- and right-hand movement will be analyzed to build the networks subtending each task and compare their different properties in terms of organization, structure, and local indices.

## Dataset
The EEG data are available from PhysioNet, “EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset” [1]. The referenced web page contains a detailed description of the experimental protocol and metadata contained in the files. The whole dataset contains data acquired from 109 subjects, each containing 14 runs (files) of acquisition. Only a selection of the files is relevant to this project. Data is provided in EDF files (European Data Format). This format includes metadata, among which the sampling frequency and the channel labels.
